# Example of Flask with Mapbox
This is the example of how to make EventSource with Flask for long-running task. I simulate the long-running task which calculates the position to put a marker on the map. 

1. You need to have MAPBOX ACCESS_KEY

```
export MAPBOX_ACCESSKEY=<your access key>
```

2. Then run the server

```
python server.py
```
